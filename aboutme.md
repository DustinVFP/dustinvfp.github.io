# About
### Who am i
Hello You can call me Dustin and i am an artist and occasionally newbie programmer, as of writing this i spend most of my time making and experimenting with art but occasionally i will experiment in programming and attempt to make something with code. 

### What have i made
so far i haven't really made anything noteworthy or post worthy with programming though i have attempted to make a few things though i lacked the motivation or drive to really finish any of them since all my motivation and time goes to my other hobby aka art which leads me to that. \
Art, i am an active artist though like with programming i haven't made a lot of noteworthy things here either mainly because i spend most of my time making little doodles that i can finish within an hour, but i have made at least a few larger art projects though none of them noteworthy enough to get a lot of attention (pretty much how things go and life as usual when you're new to these things)

### Other Stuff
Not really anything else i can think of to say about myself at the moment.
